Theory:

--Databases and tables: 

//Create DB, Drop DB, Rename DB and Backup DB

//Create Table, Drop Table, Alter Table, Rename table and Truncate table

//Indexes

//Data Types: 

//String and Numeric data types

//Boolean

//Date and Time data types

//Null Values

//Constraints: 

//Primary key 

//Not Null, 
//Unique, 
//Check, 
//Default, 
//Index, 
//Auto Increment

//Comments


--Practical tasks:

//Database orders_management

//Description: Create a database called orders_management

//Table customers 

//Description: Create a customers table in orders_management db. Table should hold the following
 information about customers:

//Name - mandatory 

//Email - mandatory and should be unique

//Phone - mandatory and should be unique

//Age - more than 18, if not set default value should be 99. 

//Address

//City

//Postal code - a positive number 

//Country

//GDPR consent status - has the customer given GDPR consent or not. Mandatory field.

//Customer profile status - is the profile still active. Mandatory field.

//Date and time profile created - set by default when creating a new record. Mandatory field

//--Date and time profile deactivated

//--Reason for deactivation of profile

//Notes - can hold very long notes on the customer.

//Customers table should be optimized for querying by name, email or phone.


--SQL scripts

//Create scripts that:

//Create orders_management database

//Drop orders_management database

//Backup orders_management database with timestamp

//Create customers table

//Drop customers table

//Truncate customers table

//Scripts should be with comments.


--Acceptance criteria:

//As a QA Automation trainee, I want to gain knowledge of:

//databases and tables in a relational database and how to manage them

//how to create and use indexes and understand what problem do they solve

//what data types and constraints are available in SQL and how to use them 

//how to write SQL scripts

//how to design a database and use recommended naming strategies in SQL
